* AI Obstacle
* This class is an empty one and just has some information about how the AI will navigate around the scene
* Due the to the level having lots of unique shaped objects. In some cases it can be hard to build AI navigation around these objects
* So using primitive shapes to create the navigation around a bunch of small objects for example. Has proven to be more effective for the AI navigation
* These AI obstacles work for all AI types and do not have any physics. So players wont collide with them. As they only effect the AI
* Objects are invisible and hould use the invisible face material
